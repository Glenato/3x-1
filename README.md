# 3x + 1 also called Collatz conjecture

This programme lets you :

- Run the Collatz conjecture with any integer you want
- Run the Collatz conjecture infinitly (or until you find another loop than the 4, 2, 1)
- Run the Collatz conjecture with a random number
- Show your results with a chart
- Save the chart
- And have finally somebody to tell you "HI !"
