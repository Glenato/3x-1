    print ("""\n\nThe Collatz conjecture, also known as the 3n + 1 conjecture, is a mathematical sequence defined as follows:

1) Start with any positive integer n.
2) If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n/2.
3) If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to get 3n + 1.
4) Repeat the process indefinitely, generating a sequence of numbers.

The conjecture proposes that, regardless of the starting value of n, the sequence will always eventually reach the number 1. Once the sequence reaches 1, it enters a cycle where subsequent values alternate between even and odd, continually reaching the cycle 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, and so on.

While the Collatz conjecture is easy to state and understand, proving it for all positive integers remains an unsolved problem in mathematics. The behavior of the sequence is unpredictable, and it's not known whether every sequence eventually reaches 1, or if there exists a sequence that diverges to infinity. Despite its apparent simplicity, the Collatz conjecture has intrigued mathematicians since it was first introduced by Lothar Collatz in 1937.\n
